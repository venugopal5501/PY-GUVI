Key takeaways from this chapter
Passing function as an argument in Python
A function can take multiple arguments, these arguments can be objects, variables(of same or different data types) and functions. 

Python functions are first class objects.  This assignment doesnâ€™t call the function. It takes the function object referenced by shout and creates a second name pointing to it

a="cat","kan","van"
def trial(x):
    print(x*2)
trial(a)
def map(boy,a):
    for i in a:
        boy(i)
map(trial,a)

output:
('cat', 'kan', 'van', 'cat', 'kan', 'van')
catcat
kankan
vanvan
