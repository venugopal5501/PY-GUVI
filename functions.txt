Python Functions
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.

A function can return data as a result.

functions:
def trial(name,age):
    print("Name:"+name,"age:"+age)
trial("venugopal","20")
output:
Name:venugopal age:20

return:
def trial(name,age):
    return name+age
print(trial(10,10))

output:
20
