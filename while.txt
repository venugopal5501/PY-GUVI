The while Loop
With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

while loop:
a=1
while a<=10:
    print(a)
    a+=1

output:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10

break:

a=1
while a<=10:
    print(a)
    a+=1
    if a==3:
        break

output:
1
2

continue:
i=1
while i<6:
    i = i + 1


    if i==3:
        continue
    print(i)
output:
2
4
5
6
