The For Loop
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.for loop:


for i in range(1,10):
    print(i)
output:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9

a="venu","gopl","gandhi"
for i in range(0,3):
    print(a[i])
output:
venu
gopl
gandhi

a="venu","gopl","gandhi"
for i in range(len(a)):
    print(a[i])
output:
venu
gopl
gandhi

a="venu","gopl","gandhi"
for i in "venu":
    print(i)

output:
v
e
n
u

a="venu","gopl","gandhi"
for i in a:
    print(i)
output:
venu
gopal
gandhi

a=1,2,3,43,5,6
for i in a:
    if i<3:
        print(i)
output:
1
2

for loop break:
a=1,2,3,43,5,6
for i in a:
    if i==3:
        break
    
    print(i)
output:
1
2

for loop continue:
a=1,2,3,43,5,6
for i in a:
    if i==3:
        continue
    
    print(i)
output:
1
2
43
